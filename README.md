# LearningPhaserJS

In this repo, I'm learning how to code with the Phaser game development framework of Javascript through different online resources, finished codecademy excercises and projects, and my own personal contributions.

These will be constantly updated with comments and notes (on the ones that are my personal projects) to see how I have gone from a beginner in Phaser to learning to build my own games from scratch.

Also please check out my C# repos of my beginner game development projects, as well as my block on game development as a web and software engineer! Cheers!
